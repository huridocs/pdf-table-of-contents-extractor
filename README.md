<h3 align="center">PDF Table of Contents Extraction</h3>
<p align="center">A Docker-powered service for extracting Table of Contents information from PDF documents</p>

---
This project aims to extract Table of Contents (TOC) information from PDF files using the outputs generated by the 
pdf-document-layout-analysis service. By leveraging the segmentation and classification capabilities of the underlying
analysis tool, this project automates the process of identifying and structuring the document's TOC.

You can check the pdf-document-layout-analysis service from here:

    https://github.com/huridocs/pdf-document-layout-analysis

## Quick Start
Start the service:

    make start

Get the segments from a PDF:

    curl -X POST -F 'file=@/PATH/TO/PDF/pdf_name.pdf' localhost:5070

To stop the server:

    make stop

- [Dependencies](#dependencies)
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Dependencies
* Docker Desktop 4.25.0 [install link](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Requirements
* 4 GB RAM memory

## Usage

As we mentioned at the [Quick Start](#quick-start), you can use the service simply like this:

    curl -X POST -F 'file=@/PATH/TO/PDF/pdf_name.pdf' localhost:5070

When the process is done, the output will include a list of TOCItem elements and, every TOCItem element will has this information:

        {
            "indentation": Level of indentation
            "label": Content of the respective item
            "selectionRectangles": List of rectangles for the respective item
        }


And every selectionRectangle item will include this information:

        {
            "left": Left position of the rectangle
            "top": Top position of the rectangle
            "width": Width of the rectangle
            "height": Height of the rectangle
            "page": Page number which the rectangle belongs
        }

And to stop the server, you can simply use this:

    make stop
